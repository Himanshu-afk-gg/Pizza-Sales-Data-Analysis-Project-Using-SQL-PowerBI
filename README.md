# Pizza Sales Data Analysis

## Objectives
This project aims to analyze pizza sales data to:
1. Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, average order value, and total quantity sold.
2. Identify trends in sales by time (daily and monthly) and category.
3. Determine the highest and lowest performing pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders.
4. Provide actionable insights for improving business performance.

## Overview
Using SQL queries on the pizza sales dataset, this analysis examines various aspects of pizza sales, including overall revenue, customer preferences, and seasonality. Insights derived from this data can help the pizza store optimize its inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies.

## Findings
1. **Total Revenue**: The storeâ€™s total revenue is calculated to give a high-level view of sales performance.
2. **Average Order Value**: This KPI shows the average spending per order, which can help understand customer purchasing behavior.
3. **Top-Selling Pizzas**: Identification of pizzas generating the most revenue and quantity sold.
4. **Sales Trends**: Patterns observed in daily and monthly sales help identify peak days and months for pizza sales.
5. **Sales by Category and Size**: Breakdown of sales by pizza category and size provides insight into customer preferences.

## Suggestions
1. **Focus on High-Performing Pizzas**: Promote best-selling pizzas to maximize revenue.
2. **Inventory Adjustments**: Increase stock for popular categories and sizes, particularly during peak sales periods.
3. **Promotions on Slow Days**: Offer discounts on low-sales days to drive more orders.
4. **Optimize Menu**: Consider removing low-performing pizzas or rebranding them to boost sales.

## SQL Code

## KPI Queries

### Total Revenue
```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(total_price), 0) AS Total_Revenue
FROM pizza_sales;
```

### Average Order Value
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS AVG_order_value
FROM pizza_sales;
```
### Total Quantity of Pizza Sold
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(quantity) AS Total_Quantity_of_Pizzas_Sold 
FROM pizza_sales;
```
### Total Orders
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM pizza_sales;
```
### Average Pizza per Order
```sql
SELECT 
    CAST(CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS AVG_Pizza_per_order
FROM pizza_sales;
```

## CHARTS Queries

### Daily Trend for Total Orders
```sql
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS Date_name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date);
```
### Monthly Trend for Total Orders
```sql
SELECT 
	DATENAME(MONTH, order_date) AS Month_name,
	COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_orders
		FROM pizza_sales
			GROUP BY DATENAME(MONTH, order_date)
				ORDER BY Total_orders DESC;
```

### Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category (Example: January)
```sql
WITH temp_table AS (
    SELECT
        pizza_category, SUM(total_price) AS total_sales,
        SUM(total_price) AS total_price
    FROM pizza_sales
	WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 1
    GROUP BY pizza_category
)

SELECT
    pizza_category, total_sales,
    total_price * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM temp_table) AS percentage_of_total
FROM temp_table;
```
### Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size (Example: January)
```sql
WITH temp_table AS (
    SELECT
        pizza_size, SUM(total_price) AS total_sales,
        SUM(total_price) AS total_price
    FROM pizza_sales
	WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 1
    GROUP BY pizza_size
)

SELECT
    pizza_size, ROUND(total_sales, 2) AS total_sales,
    ROUND(total_price * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM temp_table), 2) AS percentage_of_total
FROM temp_table
	ORDER BY percentage_of_total DESC;
```
## NOTE
To apply MONTH, QUARTER, WEEK filters to the queries,
You can use the WHERE CLAUSE.
Follow some of the below examples to execute filters.
```sql
WITH temp_table AS (
    SELECT
        pizza_category, SUM(total_price) AS total_sales,
        SUM(total_price) AS total_price
    FROM pizza_sales
	WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 1
    GROUP BY pizza_category
)

SELECT
    pizza_category, total_sales,
    total_price * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM temp_table) AS percentage_of_total
FROM temp_table;
```
Here MONTH(order_date) = 1 indicates that the output is for the month of January which is the 1st month of the year.
Similarly MONTH(order_date) = 4 will indicate the month of April.

```sql
WITH temp_table AS (
    SELECT
        pizza_category, SUM(total_price) AS total_sales,
        SUM(total_price) AS total_price
    FROM pizza_sales
	WHERE DATEPART(QUARTER, order_date) = 1
    GROUP BY pizza_category
)

SELECT
    pizza_category, total_sales,
    total_price * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM temp_table) AS percentage_of_total
FROM temp_table;
```
Here DATEPART(QUARTER, order_date) = 1 indicates that the output is for the 1st Quarter of the year.
Similarly, DATEPART(QUARTER, order_date) = 3 will indicate the 3rd Quarter of the year.

## BEST & WORST SELLERS

### Top 5 Pizzas by Total Revenue
```sql
SELECT TOP 5
    pizza_name,
    ROUND(SUM(total_price), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### Bottom 5 Pizzas by Total Revenue
```sql
SELECT TOP 5
    pizza_name,
    ROUND(SUM(total_price), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY total_revenue ASC;
```

### Top 5 Pizzas by Quantity Sold
```sql
SELECT TOP 5
    pizza_name,
    ROUND(SUM(quantity), 2) AS total_quantity
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;
```

### Bottom 5 Pizzas by Quantity Sold
```sql
SELECT TOP 5
    pizza_name,
    ROUND(SUM(quantity), 2) AS total_quantity
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY total_quantity ASC;
```

### Top 5 Pizzas by Total Orders
```sql
SELECT TOP 5
    pizza_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
```

### Bottom 5 Pizzas by Total Orders
```sql
SELECT TOP 5
    pizza_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY total_orders ASC;
```
## NOTE 
At the above-mentioned query 
```sql
LIMIT 5;
```
can also be used at the last by erasing the
```sql
TOP 5
```
Similarly, for all the queries where BOTTOM & TOP are required.
